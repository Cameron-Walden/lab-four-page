     <p>Black Celebration is the fifth studio album by English electronic music band Depeche Mode. 
         It was released on 17 March 1986 by Mute Records. The album further cemented the darkening sound created by 
         Alan Wilder, which the band later used for their subsequent albums Music for the Masses, Violator, and Songs
          of Faith and Devotion, a sound that was initially hinted towards on their albums Construction Time Again and
           Some Great Reward.</p>
           <p>Black Celebration reached number four on the UK Albums Chart, and has been cited as one of the most 
               influential albums of the 1980s.To promote the album, the band embarked on the Black Celebration 
               Tour. Three years after its release, Spin ranked it at number fifteen on its list of the "25 Greatest 
               Albums of All Time".</p>
